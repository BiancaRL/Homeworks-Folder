              <strong><em>Hello there, fellow adventurers, rhythm rebels, sports enthusiasts, curiosity chasers, and knowledge nerds! If you've stumbled upon this blog, 
                  you're either my new best friend or someone who's seriously lost in the labyrinth of the internet. But never fear; 
                  you're in for a treat as I take you on a hilariously wild journey through my many loves: travel, dance, sport, exploration and learning.</em></strong>

       <h2 style="text-align: start; margin: auto; width: 1000px;"><strong>About Me:</strong></h2>
       <br />
       <br />    
       <p style="text-align: justify-all; margin:auto; width: 1000px;"> Hey there, I'm Bianca Roman, and I've been on a career rollercoaster that even an economist would find unpredictable! I started my journey by 
        studying International Relations in Economy, proving that I can handle global affairs (and maybe a few global snacks along the way). But guess what? I didn't stop there. I became a Master in Human Resources, turning into an HR wizard who could make even the trickiest office
        printer cooperate. 🧙‍♂️ Now, brace yourself, because I've hit "Ctrl+Alt+Career" and embarked on a new adventure in "informatik" (yes, that's IT for the rest of us!). 
        I'mlike a coding explorer discovering the binary jungles of the digital world. So, to sum it up, I'm Bianca, a 38-year-old global economist turned HR magician, now on a quest to conquer the tech realm. 
        Ready for the ride of a lifetime? 😄🌍💼🖥️

              <li>&#8226; <strong>Travel:</strong>  The Thrill of Suitcase Tetris: While some people find packing a suitcase to be a chore, I see it as an exhilarating game of 'Suitcase Tetris.' Can I fit six pairs of shoes, three hats, and an inflatable pool floaty into a carry-on? Challenge accepted. My superpower is squeezing my entire wardrobe into a small bag.
                <br />
              Don't even get me started on the travel hacks – you know, those tips and tricks to score the best deals. I've got a whole folder of apps, secret websites, and frequent flyer programs. My quest for saving a few bucks could be a reality show on its own.
              In the grand tapestry of life, I'm weaving a story of adventure, laughter, and maybe a few delayed flights. So, join me on this hilarious, exhilarating journey, and let's see the world together—one missed connection and linguistic mishap at a time.</li>
              <br />
              <li>&#8226; <strong> Dance: </strong> is my secret passion, and it's where I turn into a rhythmic whirlwind of joy... or at least, I think I do. My dance moves are so uniquely mine that they should be patented. I dance like no one's watching, but they always are, and I'm totally cool with that. They get a show; I get a workout. </li>
              <br />
              <li>&#8226; <strong>Sport:</strong>  Sport is where I become the quirky athlete. While others focus on perfecting their game, I focus on perfecting my unique sports style. Think beach volleyball played in socks or synchronized swimming in a hot tub. I'd bring home the gold medal for originality.</li>
              <br />
              <li>&#8226; <strong>Explore and Learn New Things: </strong>But don't think that I'm done yet! "Explorer and Enthusiastic Learner Bianca" is on a never-ending quest for knowledge. When I'm not hiking up mountains, I'm scaling the peaks of encyclopedias and diving into the depths of online courses.</li>
